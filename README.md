Privacy Policy for DreamToon

Effective Date: July 1, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DreamToon collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of the DreamToon mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in a transparent manner.

1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information when you use the App:

Information You Provide Directly:

Audio Recordings: We collect audio recordings of your voice when you use the App's "dream recording" feature. These recordings capture your verbal descriptions of your dreams.

Dream Scripts/Text Data: We process the audio recordings to generate text-based "dream scripts" or summaries of your dreams. This text data is also collected and stored.

Account Information (Optional): If you create an account, we collect your email address, username, and any other information you choose to provide (e.g., profile name).

Feedback: If you contact us for support or provide feedback, we collect your contact information and the content of your message.

Information Collected Automatically (Device & Usage Data):

Device Information: We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access the App, including device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV, not UDID), and mobile network information.

Usage Data: We collect information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use, the duration of your sessions, and any error logs. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the App.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

App Functionality:

To record and process your audio descriptions of dreams.

To generate and store the text-based dream scripts.

To provide and personalize the dream analysis or storytelling features within the App based on your submitted audio and scripts.

To sync your dream data across your devices if you are logged into your account.

Product Improvement & Analytics:

To understand how users interact with the App and identify areas for improvement.

To fix bugs and troubleshoot technical issues.

AI/Machine Learning Training: We may use anonymized and aggregated audio recordings and dream scripts to train and improve the artificial intelligence and machine learning models that power the App's dream processing capabilities. Your individual, identifiable recordings and scripts will not be used for AI/ML training unless we obtain your explicit consent beforehand.

Communication:

To respond to your support inquiries and feedback.

To send you important service-related notifications (e.g., updates to our policies).

Security and Fraud Prevention:

To detect, prevent, and respond to potential fraud, abuse, or other illegal activities.

3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

Service Providers: We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting providers (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) for data storage, analytics providers, or customer support services. These providers are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or subpoena).

Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

With Your Consent: We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.

Aggregated or Anonymized Data: We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This type of data may be used for research, analysis, or marketing purposes.

4. Data Retention

We retain your audio recordings, dream scripts, and account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services. We may retain certain information for a longer period if required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g., fraud prevention, dispute resolution).

5. Your Choices and Rights

Microphone Access: You can control the App's access to your device's microphone through your device settings. If you disable microphone access, certain core features of the App will not function.

Accessing and Deleting Your Data: You can [describe how users can access/delete their data, e.g., "access and delete your stored dream recordings and scripts directly within the App's settings under 'My Dreams' or by contacting us at dreamzz.lore@gmail.com".

Account Deletion: If you wish to delete your account, please contact us at dreamzz.lore@gmail.com. Upon account deletion, we will [describe your data deletion process, e.g., "permanently delete your associated audio recordings, dream scripts, and account information, subject to any legal obligations or legitimate business purposes for retention."].

6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete it promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at dreamzz.lore@gmail.com.

7. Security

We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page within the App and/or through other appropriate communication channels (e.g., in-app notification, email). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
