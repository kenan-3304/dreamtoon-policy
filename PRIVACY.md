Effective Date: July 23, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DreamToon ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of the DreamToon mobile application (the “App”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in a transparent manner.

**Information We Collect**
We collect the following types of information when you use the App:

- Information You Provide Directly:

  - Audio Recordings: We collect audio recordings of your voice when you use the App’s recording feature.
  
  - Dream Scripts/Text Data: We process the audio recordings to generate text-based “dream scripts.”
  
  - Account Information: By creating an account, we collect your email address and username.
  
  - Feedback: If you contact us for support, we collect your contact information and the content of your message.
  
- Information Collected Automatically (Device & Usage Data):
  
  - Device Information: Device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
  
  - Usage Data: Information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use and error logs.

  - Transaction and Subscription Information: We receive transaction confirmations from the app stores and our subscription management service when you purchase a subscription. This         includes information about the subscription you purchased but does not include your credit card number or other sensitive financial information.

**How We Use Your Information**
We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- App Functionality: To record and process your audio, generate dream scripts, provide personalized features, and sync your data if you are logged in.
  
- Product Improvement & Analytics: To understand user interaction, identify areas for improvement, and fix bugs.
  
- AI/Machine Learning Training: We may use anonymized audio and dream scripts—stripped of any identifiers like email, username, or voice     metadata—to improve our AI systems. This training data is not linked back to you and cannot be used to identify you.
  
- Communication: To respond to support inquiries and send important service-related notifications.
  
- Security and Fraud Prevention: To detect, prevent, and respond to potential fraud or abuse.

**Subscriptions and Payments**
The App offers paid subscriptions that provide access to premium features. All payments are processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store ("App Stores"). We do not collect, receive, process, or store your credit card details or other sensitive payment information. We utilize a third-party subscription management service, RevenueCat, to validate and manage your subscription status. This allows us to confirm your purchase and sync your premium access across devices without handling your financial data.

**How We Share Your Information**
We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

- Service Providers: We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf. These include:

  - Cloud hosting provider supabase for data storage.

  - Analytics providers to help us understand app usage.

  - Subscription Management Provider (RevenueCat): We share a non-identifiable user ID and purchase data with RevenueCat to manage and validate your subscription status. You can review     their privacy practices at https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy.

- Legal Requirements: If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
  
- Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
  
- With Your Consent: When we have your explicit consent to do so.
  
- Aggregated or Anonymized Data: We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

**Data Retention**
We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App’s services. We may retain certain information for a longer period if required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

**Your Choices and Rights**
- Microphone Access: You can control the App’s access to your device’s microphone at any time through your device's privacy settings.
  
- Accessing and Deleting Your Data: You can access and delete your stored dream recordings and scripts directly within the App’s settings.
  
- Account Deletion: You can fully delete your account directly within the App's settings. This will also permanently delete your associated data.

**Children’s Privacy**
The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

**Security**
We implement reasonable technical and administrative security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
